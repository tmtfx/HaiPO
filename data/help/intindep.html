<font color="#000000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">String List colors:</font>
</br>
			When you load a po file their entries will be loaded in the top
			left list view. Every entry is displayed with its source string
			(the string in original language) and can be either a translated
			entry, an untranslated one, an obsolete one or a fuzzy one. The
			translated strings are written in black, the untranslated in blue,
			the obsolete in brown, and the fuzzy ones are ocher/yellow. You
			can see an example below:</font></p>
			<p>
			<br/>
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="colors.png" name="Image2" alt="list colors" align="bottom" width="1273" height="810" border="0"/>
</p>
<br/>

			</p>
			<p><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">String List elements:</font><font color="#000000">
			</br>			
			In the above screenshot you can see that 			
			when you select an element, the other window sections will
			populate with its relative data.</br>
			The source and translation fields are modified to handle plural
			entries.</br>
			The Translation Memory (TM now on), if enabled and available,
			will show you compatible suggestions for your source string</br>
			and if there's a comment, it will be shown in the comments tabs
			on the right-bottom of the window. If present, the relative tab 
			title text will change to a bold font.</br>
			If you need to add or modify the translator comment to the entry
			you can double click the source list entry, this will open a 
			little window with an input field placed there for this purpose.
			</font></p>
			<br></br>
			In the picture below you can see an example of multiple suggestions
			from the TM.
			</br>
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="tm_suggestions.png" name="Image3" alt="tm suggestions" align="bottom" width="1031" height="748" border="0"/>
</p>
			</br>
			Each suggestion has the relative percentage of correspondence by
			its side. A full correspondence has a green "100%" and lower ones
			have a violet percentage.</br>
			By single-clicking a suggestion its preview will be shown just under
			the TM suggestion list. Like this screenshot:
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="expander.png" name="Image4" alt="suggestion preview" align="bottom" width="1031" height="748" border="0"/>
</p>
			</br>
			By double-clicking a suggestion you will replace the translation
			field with the selected suggestion.
			<br></br>
			If a source string has some particular spacing, carriage returns
			(a new line), multiple spacing or tabulations, a special symbol will
			be drawn. The same happens in the suggestion preview. Those symbols
			will not be saved, they are just there to help the translator.
			Here is an example:
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="invisible_chars.png" name="Image5" alt="invisible chars" align="bottom" width="1031" height="748" border="0"/>
</p>
			<br></br>
			When a string presents a singular and a plural form, the list
			item appears with a light blue triangle on the left.
			If you select the list item, the source and the translation fields
			acquire additional tabs (the number	of translation plural forms
			depends on the language used) here it is an example:
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="plural.png" name="Image6" alt="plural forms" align="bottom" width="1031" height="748" border="0"/>
</p>
			<br></br>
			The translation field is modified to integrate the spellchecking
			function. Obviously this has to be enabled and configured properly.
			When an orthographic error is detected it will be highlighted with
			a bold red font.</br>If you keep Ctrl key down and click a
			word, a contextual menu appears with relative spell checker
			suggestions. By clicking on a spell-check suggestion you replace
			the wrong word.
			Look here an example:
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="spellcheck.png" name="Image7" alt="spell check" align="bottom" width="1031" height="748" border="0"/>
</p>
			<br></br>
			<p><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Settings windows:</font><font color="#000000">
			</br>
			Here we cover three settings windows: General Settings, Spellchecking Settings and Translation Memory Settings
			every change needs a program-restart to apply
			</br>
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="set1.png" name="Image8" alt="settings1" align="bottom" width="1028" height="745" border="0"/>
</p>
			</br>
			In <font color="#FFAA00">General Settings</font> there are 2 options:
			<ul>
				<li><p>Check language compliance between pofile and user
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Check mimetype of file</p>
			</ul>
			Both are used at file-loading time.</br>
			The first inspects the po-metadata looking for its translation language;
			if this is checked the program checks for compliance between the user
			supported language and the detected translation language.
			</br>
			The second one checks the file's MIME type. If it isn't a gettext-translation
			file the program warns the user about it. Not a blocking error, so you can
			avoid this check if you want
			<br></br>
			In <font color="#FFAA00">Spellchecking Settings</font> there are 1 option, 3 fields and a text-entry field:
			<ul>
				<li><p>Enable/Disable spellcheck</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Dictionary path</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Chars included in words</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Chars-categories excluded in words</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>The text-entry field</p>
			</ul>
			The option "Enable/Disable spellcheck" activates or deactivates the
			orthographic checks. This means that if disabled the translation field
			will not give hints on misspelled words and corrections
			</br>
			the field "Dictionary path" is the dictionary file path of your
			hunspell/myspell dictionary removed by its file extension (the actual
			complete dictionary path in the above example is
			/system/data/hunspell/fur_IT.dic)
			</br>
			The field "Chars included in words" is used for bypassing some chars that
			belongs to the excluded categories. (see below for more info)
			</br>
			The field "Chars-categories excluded in words" indicates the category types
			of chars that the HaiPO parsed chars substitution uses to let the Spelling
			correction tool avoid the chars that it can't handle. For example, Po indicates
			the Punctuations, so if our word is "table," the comma is removed by the
			string pre-processor that feeds the spellchecker.
			</br>
			The text-entry field in the bottom helps the user detect the single char unicode
			category. To know the category of your char you just need to press the key on your
			keyboard.
			<br></br>
			In <font color="#FFAA00">Translation Memory Settings</font> there are 3
			options and 3 fields:
			<ul>
				<li><p>Enable/Disable translation memory</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Enable/Disable TM local server</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Enable/Disable local server log</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Server address</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Server port</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Header size</p>
			</ul>
			</br>
			"Enable/Disable translation memory" is the global translation memory switch. The
			translation memory keeps a log of translations with its relative source strings.
			</br>
			"Enable/Disable TM local server" is an option that let you decide if use the
			internal local TM service or an external one (local or remote at your wish)
			</br>
			"Enable/Disable local server log" activates or disactivates a server log, to use
			along with TM local server
			</br>
			Server address and Server port, are the TM server coordinates to access the TM
			server. If you want to use the local server keep 127.0.0.1 address or at least a
			network address assigned to your machine, those values will be used by the client
			and the local server.
			</br>
			The field called "Header size" indicates the buffer size used for transmissions
			<br></br>
			Last but not the least, the <font color="#FFAA00">User Settings</font>:
			</br>
			<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="set2.png" name="Image9" alt="settings2" align="bottom" width="1028" height="745" border="0"/>
</p>
			</br>
			This is an important screen, these aren't just normal personal informations, these
			values will be written to the po file, as there is:
			<ul>
				<li><p>the translator name</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>his/her contact e-mail</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>the translation team name</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>and its relative e-mail</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><p>the iso code for the language used by the translator</p>
			</ul>
			</br>
			except the obvious first four points of this list, some words can be spent on the last one.
			There are two lists, one on the left which keeps the available languages (if possible
			localized as your system localization language).
			On the right there's an empty list in which we put our language.
			You just have to double click your language and it will show up on the right.
			On the left list there will be a different colour language. that's the suggested one
			based on you default localization.
			If your iso code isn't there, you can add a custom code double-clicking the last one element
			of the list.
